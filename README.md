# workDayScheduler

## Description 

This project is intended to be a workday calender that displays the hours from 9am - 5pm that user can click on to write and save any desired text. When the page is refreshed saved text will be re-loaded from the local storgae so that users can return to the page to use as their daily planer. The header of the page displays the current day, month, and time thats updated everysecond so that users can plan their day accordingly. Each time block is colour coded to showcase to the user if the time block corrospnding to the hour has past (grey), is current (red) or is in the future (green).

This project highlights the ability to use 3rd party API's such as Jquery, & Dayjs and how to use them in an effective manner to create interactive webpages for users.
Furthermore this project helps to solidify the usage of saving and loading data from the local strorage.
